Pokedex_javascript

This is a simple pokedex that show the first generation's pokemon.
It was made using HTML, CSS and Javascript.
I added the feature to click on the cards to show the pokemon's types, with a dynamic change of color. Then, I added a search bar to filter the pokedex by pokemon's name. Finally, I added a dark mode.
